% In this paper, we present a summary of the paper \cite{ma2022shieldfl}, where ShieldFl is proposed.
This paper addresses the vulnerability of \ac{ppfl} to encrypted model poisoning attacks, where a Byzantine adversary submits malicious local gradients in encrypted form.
To counter this threat, the proposed privacy-preserving defense strategy, named ShieldFL, leverages two-trapdoor homomorphic encryption.
The approach employs a secure cosine similarity method to assess the distance between encrypted gradients and introduces Byzantine-tolerance aggregation using cosine similarity for robustness across \ac{iid} and non-\ac{iid} data.
Evaluation on benchmark datasets (MNIST, KDDCup99, and Amazon) demonstrates that ShieldFL surpasses existing defense strategies, achieving significant accuracy improvements of $30\%-80\%$ against state-of-the-art model poisoning attacks in both non-\ac{iid} and \ac{iid} settings.
